# README.md
The first thing I added to GitHub
For a long time now I've been longing to be a developer,
my journey of learning how to code had not been an easy one.
I face impostor syndromes everyday
I finally got a laptop but now it has some issues
which had force me to code using my phone, coding on phone is not easy
but it's fun. Being able to write code on a beautiful code editor like Acode
is a blessing and being able to run it on Termux is a Miracle. 
Because it gives hope to all those who do not have a laptop, but they want to learn programming
To experience developers it's stressful but to me it's a wonderful experience.
Big thanks to the developers of Acode and Termux and to all those who continue to contribute to
those beautiful open source projects. I hope that one day I will be able to program and add something
contributing to these projects.
The Raywenderlich team deserves lots of compliments for creating wonderful, easy to understand books and 
resources for those who want to be mobile developers. They are good at what they do and I have to tell them THANK YOU.
Another important resources I had used is YouTube. Hundreds of content creators work tirelessly each day to create
content which in turn helps beginner like me. THANK YOU ALL ON YOUTUBE FOR YOUR GREAT WORK. YouTube had proven to be the best social media channel that is healthy for people to consume. One day I wish to be a YouTuber, so I can make 
free videos for people to learn from.

All these are not what I should write in my README page, but it's the only thing I can think of, probably in the near future I will change it to something more interesting to read. But thanks for reading anyway. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
